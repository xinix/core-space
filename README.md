# Unofficial Core Space App

Hi! My name is Nico and I love Core Space. Ever since I first saw it on
the [Esoteric Order of Gamers](https://www.orderofgamers.com/games/core-space/) I was hooked. I
bought the core game and every expansion available. In 2020 I backed the First Born kickstarter and
also got everything ðŸ˜‹.

This year I volunteered to demo First Born at Spiel in Essen, Germany and was lucky enough to be
selected. I demoed the game for two days and got to work with Colin, Steward and Simon. After Essen
I got the idea to make an App for Core Space where players can lookup the item tokens they find the
game and get a detailed explanation about the symbols.

And here it is, both base games (Core Space and First Born) and most expansions are added. The
webapp is free for anyone to use and can even be installed on your phone. I still have to add the
two latest Core Space expansions (Black Star Rising / Wanted: Dead or Alive).
